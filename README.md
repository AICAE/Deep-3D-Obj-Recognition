# 3D Object Recognition with Deep Networks
This is the 3D Object Recognition with Deep Networks Project for the 3D Vision course at ETHZ
  
##What is needed:  
* 3D CAD data to Voxel Data (Traning Data by WU et al.)
* 2.5D Point Cloud Data to Voxel Data (Project Tango)  
* 3D Point Cloud Data to Voxel Data (Extra Training Data Sets)
* VoxNet  
  * Convolutional Neural Network
* 3D Shape Net  
  * Special Learning Algorithm
  * Convolutional Deep Beliefe Network
